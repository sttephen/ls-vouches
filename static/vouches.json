    "vouch": "One of the best courses I've ever taken! I was a bit skeptical about it at first because there are already a lot of free resources on Minecraft plugin development. But this course hits a bit differently. Before taking this course, I had mostly learned MC plugin development on my own. After a few years, I lost interest in Minecraft and stopped with plugin development. Recently I rediscovered Minecraft and wanted to start again. As my knowledge had faded a bit, I wanted to refresh it with the help of this course. And I have to say in just a few weeks I learned a lot, especially a lot of best practices, but also many advanced topics such as scoreboards, minigame development, etc. I highly recommend this course to everyone! I normally don't like online courses because I learn very little or a lot of bad examples are taught, but this one is definitely worth it! üòç Good job Stephen for providing us with such an interesting masterpiece. You really changed my opinion on online courses. Keep up the great work! I am also very happy to be a part of this discord community as well. Everyone here is super friendly and I hope to contribute a little myself in the future üôÇ"

The Spigot course is just perfect, and has everything I need to know to start coding my plugin. I didn't even realize how much I have learned from you! The Discord server is great and the community is kind! I am working on a plugin for my server that acts like Essentials, only with the messages that I want. You are the best instructor out there, and I enjoy learning from you! I only wish I could put more stars on this course for the rating. üôÇ Thank you so much for everything that you have put in this course! Have a great day! I am so grateful for being a student in this course. Thank you to all the staff and especially to Mr. Stephen for making this experience the best ever! I can't wait to continue on my learning path! This is honestly one of the best courses that you can take! I have much knowledge, confidence, motivation, and love for programming because of this! It really does change your life in the best way possible! You all are the best! Best Regards, OPCoder"

They want to make sure everyone will be able to get the most critical information to help them become the best developers they can be. It explains everything perfectly. From personal experience it is very hard to stay motivated, but if you do. It can change your life and it lets you meet some of the most amazing people ever. Without this course, I wouldn't be where I am at. It is 100% worth every little bit of money that it cost. It shouldn't be as cheap as it is. Just be dedicated and I promise you will see improvement and make sure to ASK QUESTIONS. The discord is part of the course. Use all of the resources that Stephen provides and you will be amazed at how fast you will learn. To end it - Thank you Stephen and the entire Staff/Support team and anyone who has contributed to creating the course. You all have changed my life! ‚ù§ I love you all!"

I have a hard time self-teaching myself. Mainly to stay motivated and to just keep going. I'd like to say I have the skill level of someone who has been coding for at least a year! I will say this community has been absolutely the best one I have ever seen. The amount of support and kindness that everyone gives is unbelievable. Stephen has always been active and has always been a part of it. He's one of the kindest and most hardworking people I have ever seen. He does all of this just to help everyone do what they dream of. He's never done it for the money. He's given everyone the biggest discount that Udemy would allow. He's built such an amazing thing and he's made multiple people make their dreams come true (such as mine). Due to this course. I am actually starting my first year of college majoring in Software Engineering. What is even crazier is this course has actually allowed me to skip a couple of classes due to the knowledge I was able to gain. This saved me A LOT of money as well as time. Thank you for never giving up Stephen and always be for every one of your students! The support team has never failed to amaze me. Every single time I come here no matter how easy/hard the question is, how annoying I could be, or how long it may take. They never give up nor make fun of you. They are genuine people and love each and every student here, and they all volunteer to do all of this. No one here is getting paid to be a staff member and to help any of us (that I know of lol)."

It's just the best Minecraft plugin developing course you can find (even free ones are not complete, this one can teach you a lot of things in details and good explained). And also Stephen is trying to make it cheaper for everyone. So I would recommend buying this course for the following reasons: Really cool community, you understand everything in the course because it's explained in details (If you don't understand something you can ask here, the course is updated every time whenever is needed. If u want to buy this course just go here => https://www.udemy.com/course/develop-minecraft-plugins-java-programming/"

Just from lurking alone in help channels you‚Äôll learn a lot of things. We also have to mention some incredible staff members who really spend hours of their day helping and giving tips. There are also 70 channels (if I counted correctly) with extra information which are explained really well. I‚Äôd say the discord alone is already worth the money.

Many developers who started around the time I did remember the days of SpigotMC(no slander) when you‚Äôd ask a simple question and more experienced developers would laugh it off or tell you to learn more rather than helping you take that next step. That being said Stephen has successfully nurtured an environment of helpful people who want to see new developers grow, with the best interest of the future in his mind and to that a massive cheers. I‚Äôd highly recommend the course to anyone, whether you just started or you‚Äôre 7 years into it there‚Äôs plenty of useful resources and people to utilize üôÇ"

    "vouch": "I started this course back in October, and I was really excited to explore this new aspect of Minecraft having played the game for almost 10 years beforehand. At the time, it had everything I wanted to learn: Commands, Events, Bungeecord Integration, Minigame Creation, Particle Effects, Custom GUI's, Holographic Displays and it was perfect. Without hesitation I bought the course and began my learning. **It was a slow start**. The majority of people who did not have a good experience with this course did not understand and follow the paradigm of learning. Especially with programming, everything takes time and patience. Learning Java is essential to what you do with the rest of the course, and Stephen covers this beautifully in the first few sections of the Course. You have to be willing to have a good mindset, and to rewatch lectures 3-4 times before fully understanding the concept. You have to be willing to take risks and to START making something, so you can see where you go wrong, correct, learn and expand. Many of the 1 Star √¢¬≠¬ê√Ø¬∏¬è reviews seen below are from students who never reached out for support, who never asked a single Q in the Q&A section, or barely even started the course. In order to be successful in any learning process, you need to take action for yourself. The course WILL do the rest for you. Stephen puts blood sweat and tears into creating high quality 25+ hour lectures and is extremely extensive to any aspiring Bukkit/Spigot developer. The course includes everything you could possibly need, and it's JAM packed with pure knowledge. After 6 months of dedication towards covering the course (even at times where I wanted to quit, or just stop learning) I INSTANTLY saw the change in my learning, I started understanding and fully applying the concepts taught in the lectures, to my real world programming. It could take less or more than 6 months, but with 100% guarantee this course IS WORTH THE TIME. It is a robbery that this course is available for around $15, dropping even lower at certain points in time. In return I have made hundreds of dollars just from the content of this course, and that is purely magical. If you put hard work, you will get stunning results. Stephen does a remarkable job at making sure that the course stays fully up to date, with the highest quality videos available. A recent course remake was implemented, where he **rerecorded** ALL his lectures and adjusted them based off fined tuned feedback from students, and the remake was excellent. It's high quality, it's detailed, and most importantly, its packed with knowledge and understanding. √¢‚Ç¨¬®√¢‚Ç¨¬®The partnered discord server also deserves a huge amount of appreciation. The discord server that accompanies this course is for all students who wish to have their questions and programming doubts clarified in an instant. The staff members who help support and guide students are affable, talented, extremely hardworking and dedicated and are always looking at ways to improve. Stephen runs polls with students to gain better insight on what YOU want, and implements them without hesitation, students come feeling lost, and in a matter of 10 minutes, they are fully equipped with the knowledge to continue what they are doing, and that will not, should not, and cannot be taken for granted. It is a stunning learning tool and if you make the effort to seek support, your efforts will be rewarded. Do NOT hesitate to purchase this course, you will feel frustrated, lost, and confused during portions of your development journey, but there are over 30+ people to help you with your problems, and 3000+ students who are all in your exact position. So? What are you waiting for?"

To be honest it is the best thing that I have ever bought. The author is really friendly and he also still updates this course with new lectures! I can really recommend buying it even if you have small experiences with java ^^. Have in mind that learning how to code isn't really easy, it can be frustrating and take a lot of time. I have been learning it around 1 month and 7 hours everyday. I still have to learn a lot, of course, but I can already understand the code and I know what I am doing. Thank you very much Stephen for making this course!"

I came into this course knowing 0 information on Java, heck even coding! This course has given me all the knowledge I have needed to make the games I've always wanted to play and create when I was younger. I can say with 100% confidence, that this was the best money I've spent, and way worth my time and money for learning Spigot/Bukkit and Java. Now that I have somewhat finished the course, I can say that I have learned a whole new concept of knowledge. Great instructor and great community.

Make a plugin with what you learn and you can easily make hundreds and even thousands of dollars selling plugins you make. Stephen also takes time to explain things, instead of some Udemy courses where they just type a bunch of code and expect you to just copy and have no clue what‚Äôs happening. Stephen doesn‚Äôt just code plugins and you sit there and watch him and copy all his code. He teaches you what you need to know to go make your *ownnn* plugin.

There's not many people who would continue to dedicate so much of his time to the course years later with constant updates, new content, Udemy q&a support, and even fun events like plugin jams. A lot of course instructors could easily sit back and just treat this as passive income, but not stephen - he genuinely cares about every single person who purchases this course and I have nothing but respect for the guy. Not only is this Discord a wonderful place to ask questions about the course, it's also one of the only places I genuinely feel appreciated. This course has provided me the knowledge to succeed in my educational studies, not just my personal interest in the field. I cannot recommend this course more - I started this course with next to no programming experience and I'm now an Admin and Teaching Assistant, which is a testament to how much this course can do for you if you put the time in. 100% worth every penny. Best ¬£10 I've ever spent."

I remember when I first joined, I felt immediately welcome into the community. Some of the main reasons are as follows:- All my questions were answered almost immediately by the amazing staff and support team, and when they weren't online, students helped each other. - The support are welcoming, and I know this will sound cheesy, but supportive. I started to realize that with this course, I could start to code more complex plugins. I went from starting small with plugins like a Discord Inviter, where you got an invite link from a command, all the way up to now where I can code Custom Armor Sets, where you were an entire set to gain perks, and complete cores. I understand that some people may think that this course is bogus and that you won't learn anything, just like watching videos from YouTube, but trust me, this service is amazing. As a semi-experienced developer, I strongly stand by this course. Stephen really deserves a round of applause for making plugin development to easy to learn!"

I've had it for only about a little over 2 days now and I feel like I've learned a lot. I recommend this course to anyone looking to learn!"

    "vouch": "When it comes to support/discord server it is not good, it is EXCELLENT. And when you see the banner with an average 2-minute response they are not lying. I've tried getting some basic help from multiple discord servers, forums, etc. I always get links to a solution on Stack Overflow with 'try this, if this does not work idk'. while on the course discord server, they are basically staying overnight trying to solve your issues until it is solved. I've opened a dozen of tickets and each and everyone was solved in 2 days. As a conclusion to all of you asking if it is worth it? If you want to start coding and want to focus on Minecraft, then yes, you will not waste any money as you get real responses from, community that is always ready to review your resource, give you feedback and help you."
