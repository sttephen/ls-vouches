    "vouch": "One of the best courses I've ever taken! I was a bit skeptical about it at first because there are already a lot of free resources on Minecraft plugin development. But this course hits a bit differently. Before taking this course, I had mostly learned MC plugin development on my own. After a few years, I lost interest in Minecraft and stopped with plugin development. Recently I rediscovered Minecraft and wanted to start again. As my knowledge had faded a bit, I wanted to refresh it with the help of this course. And I have to say in just a few weeks I learned a lot, especially a lot of best practices, but also many advanced topics such as scoreboards, minigame development, etc. I highly recommend this course to everyone! I normally don't like online courses because I learn very little or a lot of bad examples are taught, but this one is definitely worth it! 😍 Good job Stephen for providing us with such an interesting masterpiece. You really changed my opinion on online courses. Keep up the great work! I am also very happy to be a part of this discord community as well. Everyone here is super friendly and I hope to contribute a little myself in the future 🙂"

Stephen is the type of person to teach you how to fish and give you the rod to make your own decisions, and that's what a course needs to have: an instructor that teaches the student the beginnings of something for it to expand later on if he wants to. not gonna lie, there's stuff I don't understand AT ALL, but the purpose of this community is that: learn what we don't know. I would definitely buy this course another 69 times and re-do it another 69 times. thank you Stephen, for providing a way of learning to many devs here."

The Spigot course is just perfect, and has everything I need to know to start coding my plugin. I didn't even realize how much I have learned from you! The Discord server is great and the community is kind! I am working on a plugin for my server that acts like Essentials, only with the messages that I want. You are the best instructor out there, and I enjoy learning from you! I only wish I could put more stars on this course for the rating. 🙂 Thank you so much for everything that you have put in this course! Have a great day! I am so grateful for being a student in this course. Thank you to all the staff and especially to Mr. Stephen for making this experience the best ever! I can't wait to continue on my learning path! This is honestly one of the best courses that you can take! I have much knowledge, confidence, motivation, and love for programming because of this! It really does change your life in the best way possible! You all are the best! Best Regards, OPCoder"

They want to make sure everyone will be able to get the most critical information to help them become the best developers they can be. It explains everything perfectly. From personal experience it is very hard to stay motivated, but if you do. It can change your life and it lets you meet some of the most amazing people ever. Without this course, I wouldn't be where I am at. It is 100% worth every little bit of money that it cost. It shouldn't be as cheap as it is. Just be dedicated and I promise you will see improvement and make sure to ASK QUESTIONS. The discord is part of the course. Use all of the resources that Stephen provides and you will be amazed at how fast you will learn. To end it - Thank you Stephen and the entire Staff/Support team and anyone who has contributed to creating the course. You all have changed my life! ❤ I love you all!"

I have a hard time self-teaching myself. Mainly to stay motivated and to just keep going. I'd like to say I have the skill level of someone who has been coding for at least a year! I will say this community has been absolutely the best one I have ever seen. The amount of support and kindness that everyone gives is unbelievable. Stephen has always been active and has always been a part of it. He's one of the kindest and most hardworking people I have ever seen. He does all of this just to help everyone do what they dream of. He's never done it for the money. He's given everyone the biggest discount that Udemy would allow. He's built such an amazing thing and he's made multiple people make their dreams come true (such as mine). Due to this course. I am actually starting my first year of college majoring in Software Engineering. What is even crazier is this course has actually allowed me to skip a couple of classes due to the knowledge I was able to gain. This saved me A LOT of money as well as time. Thank you for never giving up Stephen and always be for every one of your students! The support team has never failed to amaze me. Every single time I come here no matter how easy/hard the question is, how annoying I could be, or how long it may take. They never give up nor make fun of you. They are genuine people and love each and every student here, and they all volunteer to do all of this. No one here is getting paid to be a staff member and to help any of us (that I know of lol)."

It's just the best Minecraft plugin developing course you can find (even free ones are not complete, this one can teach you a lot of things in details and good explained). And also Stephen is trying to make it cheaper for everyone. So I would recommend buying this course for the following reasons: Really cool community, you understand everything in the course because it's explained in details (If you don't understand something you can ask here, the course is updated every time whenever is needed. If u want to buy this course just go here => https://www.udemy.com/course/develop-minecraft-plugins-java-programming/"

I learned so much and became so creative with my plugins.

The fact the course is still being updated to this day is also crazy to me. We should not forget this discord though. I have been in the discord for like 8 months, and I have learned a LOT. Just from lurking alone in help channels you’ll learn a lot of things. We also have to mention some incredible staff members who really spend hours of their day helping and giving tips. There are also 70 channels (if I counted correctly) with extra information which are explained really well. I’d say the discord alone is already worth the money. Right now I don’t need to use the course to create my plugins, but it’s a great fall-back for if you forgot something and want to check how it worked real quick. Great course, great community 🤝"

Many developers who started around the time I did remember the days of SpigotMC(no slander) when you’d ask a simple question and more experienced developers would laugh it off or tell you to learn more rather than helping you take that next step. That being said Stephen has successfully nurtured an environment of helpful people who want to see new developers grow, with the best interest of the future in his mind and to that a massive cheers. I’d highly recommend the course to anyone, whether you just started or you’re 7 years into it there’s plenty of useful resources and people to utilize 🙂"

I started learning and trust me, I am learning really slowly, however it automaticly went into my head and i started remembering it. After a 1 year, I have created a development service, and decided to make a plugins called AquaKits, AquaHub, (15 customers). Trust me It is the best feeling if you will see a people liking your plugins and that you can make some money of it. In my opinion the course should costs more then it is now. 🙂"

The course is great and the support and Discord server is helpful a ton. I can't wait to see whats new in the course remake in 2022. I came into this course knowing 0 information on Java, heck even coding! This course has given me all the knowledge I have needed to make the games I've always wanted to play and create when I was younger. I can say with 100% confidence, that this was the best money I've spent, and way worth my time and money for learning Spigot/Bukkit and Java. Now that I have somewhat finished the course, I can say that I have learned a whole new concept of knowledge. Great instructor and great community. I would very much recommend this to anyone interested in learning Spigot/Bukkit/Java"

The course is well worth the money, and the people whom are reviewing it have stated that it's too fast, without fully watching the videos are clearly rushing into writing a review without listening to the videos. I hugely personally enjoy listening to the videos first, on a train or bus, then re-watching to practice the code itself. Would recommend doing the same for any new people to Java.

Been programming in java for three years, and I now know other languages like python, swift, js, etc. All of it came from this course, which first showed me all the possibilities of code. Who knew? Out of five stars, easy ten. Only cost me twenty bucks and it was incredibly worth it. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

It’s value is worth wayyy more than that. Stephen pours hours upon hours making lectures, and helping people in the Discord. The return on this is crazy. Spend $10 or $20. Make a plugin with what you learn and you can easily make hundreds and even thousands of dollars selling plugins you make. Stephen also takes time to explain things, instead of some Udemy courses where they just type a bunch of code and expect you to just copy and have no clue what’s happening. Stephen doesn’t just code plugins and you sit there and watch him and copy all his code. He teaches you what you need to know to go make your *ownnn* plugin. And Stephen’s just an over all, friendly guy :)"

Of course you still need to put in a lot of work to get anywhere, but that’s with anything in life. However the community discord has so many helpful support members that can guide you as you learn. I cannot recommend this course enough, it’s just amazing in every way possible."

This course has given me all the knowledge I have needed to make the games I've always wanted to play and create when I was younger. I can say with 100% confidence, that this was the best money I've spent, and way worth my time and money for learning Spigot/Bukkit and Java. Now that I have somewhat finished the course, I can say that I have learned a whole new concept of knowledge. Great instructor and great community.

This course teaches you many things with the vast catalogue of videos like being resilient and not giving up when things don't work the first time, teamwork for when you collaborate with other developers and even responsibility for maintaining your creations. If you feel like you want to let loose your imagination, make some passive income, learn how to programme AND learn the Spigot library whilst also being a part of a growing friendly community who are able to support you with your coding journey then this is the course for you!

Not only is this Discord a wonderful place to ask questions about the course, it's also one of the only places I genuinely feel appreciated. This course has provided me the knowledge to succeed in my educational studies, not just my personal interest in the field.

I remember when I first joined, I felt immediately welcome into the community. Some of the main reasons are as follows:- All my questions were answered almost immediately by the amazing staff and support team, and when they weren't online, students helped each other. - The support are welcoming, and I know this will sound cheesy, but supportive. I started to realize that with this course, I could start to code more complex plugins. I went from starting small with plugins like a Discord Inviter, where you got an invite link from a command, all the way up to now where I can code Custom Armor Sets, where you were an entire set to gain perks, and complete cores. I understand that some people may think that this course is bogus and that you won't learn anything, just like watching videos from YouTube, but trust me, this service is amazing. As a semi-experienced developer, I strongly stand by this course. Stephen really deserves a round of applause for making plugin development to easy to learn!"
